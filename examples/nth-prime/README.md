# Nth-Prime

This function returns the nth prime, where the 1st prime is 2. It works by finding the number which has n-1 primes below it and itself is prime.

It only requires sum, product (which can be swapped with sum for a larger function), abs, floor, ln, and basic arithmetic. It can run on a scientific calculator, albeit very, very slowly. It's also very likely that there could be improvements. If you see any, let me know (or make a pull request).

The source code can be found in [main.lm](./main.lm). The compiled function can be found in [equation.txt](./equation.txt) (this can be directly copy-pasted into Desmos). An image of the function can be found in [image.png](./image.png).
